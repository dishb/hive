    <h1>Security Policy</h1>
    This document details how security issues and vulnerabilities will be handled.
</div>

## Supported Versions

It is recommended to always use the latest release/version of `hive`. This is because only the latest major version of `hive` will recieve security updates and fixes. Older major versions will not recieve updates. Major version refers to the `Y` in `vX.Y.Z`. For example, if the latest major version is `vX.Y.Z`, only versions with `vX.Y.0` or higher will recieve security updates. Development versions will (obviously) recieve security updates and fixes.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a security issue or vulnerability, please do not open a public issue. Instead, privately [email](mailto:code.dishb@gmail.com) me.
From there, we will discuss the issue and proceed with releasing a patch for the vulnerability.
